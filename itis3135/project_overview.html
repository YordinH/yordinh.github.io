  <h2>Client Project Project Overview: Queen City Fitness Coaching</h2>

  <h3>Client and Project Category Selection</h3>

  <h4>Step 01: Client Category</h4>
  <p>
    For this project, I selected <strong>Category 01: client is a peer classmate</strong>.
    My client is a classmate who is treated as the owner of a small personal
    training business for the purposes of this assignment.
  </p>

  <h4>Step 02: Project Category</h4>
  <p>
    For the project category, I selected:
    <strong>Design and develop a web-based application for an individual that I know
    to promote their professional or community projects.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    The web application will promote the client’s professional fitness coaching
    services, help potential clients learn about what is offered, and provide
    simple ways to request more information or a consultation.
  </p>

  <h3>Project Overview</h3>

  <h4>Application Description and Purpose</h4>
  <p>
    The proposed application is a marketing and information website for
    <strong>Queen City Fitness Coaching</strong>, a small personal training and fitness
    coaching business based in Charlotte. The purpose of the website is to
    clearly explain the coach’s services, training philosophy, and example
    programs, and to make it easy for visitors to contact the coach to request a
    consultation or ask questions. The site will also include basic educational
    content that helps beginners feel more comfortable starting a fitness plan.
  </p>

  <h4>Intended Users of the Website</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Local beginners:</strong> People in the Charlotte area who are new to working
      out and want safe, guided plans.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Busy students and professionals:</strong> Users who have limited time and
      want efficient, tailored workouts and coaching.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Intermediate lifters:</strong> Users who already go to the gym but want help
      with programming, accountability, or improving technique.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Remote clients:</strong> Users who are not in Charlotte but are interested in
      online coaching, check-ins, and written programs.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Overview of the Website Content</h4>
  <p>
    The website will consist of at least five main pages (this proposal plans for
    six), including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A <strong>Home</strong> page that introduces Queen City Fitness Coaching and
      highlights the main calls to action.
    </li>
    <li>
      An <strong>About</strong> page that explains who the coach is, what their
      qualifications are, and their training philosophy.
    </li>
    <li>
      A <strong>Services</strong> page that describes the different coaching options
      offered.
    </li>
    <li>
      A <strong>Training Programs</strong> page that shows example read-only workout
      structures and uses interactive filters or tabs.
    </li>
    <li>
      A <strong>Success Stories &amp; Gallery</strong> page that displays testimonials
      and an interactive photo gallery.
    </li>
    <li>
      A <strong>Contact</strong> page with a form that lets visitors request a
      consultation or ask questions.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The site will also include interactive elements such as an image gallery,
    form validation, a jQuery UI widget, and AJAX-based loading of sample
    program data. All dynamic functionality will be read-only, in line with the
    course requirement that no CRUD storage is implemented.
  </p>

  <h3>Site Map</h3>
  <p>
    Before starting development, a site map was created using Draw.io to show
    all pages and how they are linked through the navigation bar. The site map
    uses a simple hierarchical structure with a single global navigation bar
    providing one-click access to each top-level page.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Planned pages in the site map:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Home (index.html)</li>
    <li>About (about.html)</li>
    <li>Services (services.html)</li>
    <li>Training Programs (programs.html)</li>
    <li>Success Stories &amp; Gallery (gallery.html)</li>
    <li>Contact (contact.html)</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Default Page Wireframe</h3>
  <p>
    A wireframe for the default page layout was also created in Draw.io. This
    layout will be reused across all pages so that the header, navigation bar,
    and footer remain consistent. The wireframe includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A top header with the site name and tagline.</li>
    <li>A horizontal navigation bar with links to all main pages.</li>
    <li>A main content area with a hero section and supporting content blocks.</li>
    <li>A footer that includes contact information and HTML/CSS validation links.</li>
  </ul>

  </ul>

  <h3>Dynamic Functionality on the Website</h3>
  <p>
    The web application will include several forms of dynamic functionality that
    make use of JavaScript. All interactions will
    respect the course constraint that the site does not perform full CRUD
    operations or store user data on a server.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Contact form with validation (Contact page):</strong> The contact form will
      use JavaScript to validate required fields, check email format, and display
      feedback messages to the user.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>FAQ accordion (About page):</strong> A component will allow
      users to expand and collapse frequently asked questions, improving
      readability and organization.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Interactive program filters:</strong>
      Program summaries will be loaded from a local JSON file and then
      displayed based on the user’s selected goal or category.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Interactive image gallery (Success Stories &amp; Gallery page):</strong>
      Clicking on thumbnails will open a larger image in a modal/lightbox view,
      potentially using a jQuery or JavaScript plugin.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Smooth scrolling and highlight effects (Home and Services pages):</strong>
      Simple JavaScript enhancements will provide smooth scrolling to sections
      and visual highlighting when users interact with buttons and navigation
      links.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Example Inspiration URLs</h4>

    inspire the implementation in this project (not copied, only used for ideas):
