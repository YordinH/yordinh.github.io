        <p>Hello, my name is Yordin Hasty. I am a senior studying computer science. 
            I am originally from Durham, NC, and transferred to UNCC my junior year. 
            I love taking on new hobbies and challenges and am always looking for my next project.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Personal Background:</b> I have lived in Durham, NC almost my entire life.
                 I was originally born in Guatemala before being adopted and brought to the US. I now live here in Charlotte.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Professional Background:</b> I have worked at Chick-fil-A since I was 18. I have transferred a couple times between stores before.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Academic Background:</b> I got an associate degree in engineering from Durham tech. I was homeschooled during high school.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Primary Computer:</b> I split my work between my built windows PC at home and my macbook pro on the go. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Courses I’m Taking, & Why:</b>
                <ul>
                   <li>
                    ITIS 4166 – Backend Application Development: My major is software engineering, hence this class is key in understanding backend systems and services
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    ITIS 3135 – Front-End Web Application Development: Required. Not the most exciting class as I have already taught myself html, css, and javascript.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    ITCS 3153 – Intro Artificial Intelligence: AI keeps advancing. I think that taking AI classes to improve my understanding of how AI works will help me stay competitive with the changing technologies. 
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    ITSC 3146 – Intro Oper Syst & Networking: Required. Not too interested in this but still definitely needed.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    ITCS 4180 – Mobile Application Development: I needed to take this class as my friends and I are forming a business, and need an app to be developed.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    ITSC 4155 – Software Development Projects: Required, wanted to get my capstone finished with.
                   </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I’d also Like to Share: Along with being co-founder of a business, I also dedicate a decent amount of my time to day trading. In my freetime, I love to read and learn about how money, the market, and financial systems move and operate.
